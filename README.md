# UK-Census
I have been provided with a mock census of a modest town, where I am to consider myself to be part of a local government team who will be making decisions on what to do with an unoccupied plot of land and what to invest in.  It is worthy of note that this town is a modest one and it is sandwiched between two much larger cities
The purpose of this is to compare different people across the town and to provide the government with accurate statistics of the population to enable better planning, to develop policies, and to allocate certain funding.
However the data provided contains so many errors, which has to be cleaned in order for it to be useful and reliable for our analysis and decision.
